**Sarcos Software Quiz**

Implementation of the requested functionality to pretty print vector, matrices and nodes.

**Assumptions that prompted my design decisions:**

* Structs were to be used more like legacy code and not converted to C++ classes
* A sufficient "Pretty Print" for vectors and matrices are aligned numbers and options to set column width and/or floating point precision
* A simple main application is all that is necessary to provide the functionality
* Treating the "Node* children" member of Node struct more like "Node* child" given the single pointer.
